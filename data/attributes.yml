        (RealityCom) defines how well a robot understands cause and effect in
        the physical world.

        Use this attribute to calculate the trajectory of an object, or to
        understand why something is on re. Robots with high RealityCom ratings
        are able to easily understand concepts like gravity or the physical
        nature of their environment.

        A robot’s dice pool to launch a projectile is its RealityCom rating +
        Reflexes rating.

        A robot’s RealityCom pool may be added to certain Perception checks, at
        the Programmer’s discretion.

-   name: HumanCom
    category: Intelligence
    desc: |
        (HumanCom) defines how well a robot understands human minds or organic
        actions.

        Use this attribute to ascertain the motives of organic life, or to
        determine the functions of their equipment.

        Robots with low HumanCom ratings are not very “user-friendly”, while
        robots with high HumanCom ratings often display very human-like
        behavior.

        A robot’s dice pool to manage or communicate with organics is its
        HumanCom rating + Perception rating.

-   name: DigiCon
    category: Intelligence
    desc: |
        (DigiCon) defines how adept a robot is at interacting with non-physical
        systems like computers.

        Use this attribute to interface with computer systems or reprogram
        other robots.

        A robot uses its DigiCon pool to remove OS Threshold damage in icted
        during reprogramming attempts. See Reprogramming a Robot on page 18 for
        more information.

        A robot’s OS Threshold rating is equal to its DigiCon rating + Buffer
        rating.

-   name: MechaniCon
    category: Intelligence
    desc: |
        (MechaniCon) defines how adept a robot is at interacting with
        mechanical systems, like controlling a drone or adjusting a factory’s
        automatic building units to construct machines of a novel design.

        Use this attribute to remotely control other robots, or to rewire
        mechanical systems.

        A robot’s dice pool to repair physical damage to itself or other robots
        is its MechaniCon rating + Dexterity rating. See Repairing a Robot on
        page 17 for more information.

-   name: Dexterity
    category: Chassis
    short: Dex
    desc: |
        (Dex) measures the degree of fine motor control necessary for
        interaction with the outside world.

        Use this attribute to make fine adjustments with a manipulative
        appendage or to tap in a precise sequence of key punches.

        A robot’s dice pool for manually interacting with other objects is its
        Dexterity rating + Reflexes rating.

-   name: Mobility
    category: Chassis
    short: Mobil
    desc: |
        (Mobil) dictates the robot’s capability to propel itself about the
        environment (wheels, ambulatory limbs, etc).

        Use this attribute to climb over obstacles or move across rough terrain
        without being slowed.

        A robot with a Mobility rating of 0 cannot move on its own, no matter
        what its Reflexes rating is.

        The TN to touch, strike, or otherwise physically interact with an
        unwilling robot is the target robot’s Mobility rating + Reflexes rating.

-   name: Perception
    category: Chassis
    short: Per
    desc: |
        (Per) determines the variety and quality of sensors mounted, as well as
        information relayed back.

        This is the dice pool a robot has to notice objects, features, sounds,
        or other external stimuli.

        The Programmer may require the robot to use its Buffer rating instead
        of its Perception rating in certain situations, such as when attempting
        to see through re, or to detect speci c noises in a very noisy setting.

-   name: Reflexes
    category: Chassis
    short: Ref
    desc: |
        (Ref) determines response lag and overall speed of animation.

        In conflict situations, initiative is determined by rolling a d10 and
        adding the robot’s Reflexes rating. Robots with higher initiative
        totals act first.

        A robot’s maximum speed is equal to its Mobility rating + Reflexes
        rating in kilometers per hour or meters per round.

        A robot with a Reflexes rating of 0 cannot move on its own, no matter
        what its Mobility rating is.

-   name: Strength
    category: Chassis
    short: Str
    desc: |
        (Str) determines the robot’s maximum load capacity and ability to
        inflict brute-force damage on other objects.

        Two robots attempting to move each other both make Strength checks. The
        TN is (the target robot's Size rating - the acting robot's Size rating)
        +5. The robot with more successes is the victor.

        The TN to drag an unmoving robot is (the unmoving robot’s Size rating -
        the pushing robot's Size rating) + 5.

        If a robot strikes another object, the strike inflicts damage equal to
        one-half the attacking robot’s Strength rating (round down, minimum
        damage of zero).

-   name: Durability
    category: Crux
    short: Dur
    desc: |
        (Dur) measures how much damage a robot can withstand before ceasing
        operation or being destroyed.

        A robot’s maximum Damage Threshold is equal to its Durability rating +
        Size rating.

        If the robot's Damage Threshold is degraded by an attack or object, it
        must make a Durability check. Each success (TN 8) reduces the damage in
        icted by 1 (minimum damage of 0).

        A robot ceases operation when its current Damage Threshold rating
        degrades to 0.

-   name: Buffer
    category: Crux
    short: Buf
    desc: |
        (Buf) is a rating of the robot’s ability to withstand information
        overload due to bright lights, EM pulses, conflicting programming
        orders, or other disruptive conditions.

        The TN to reprogram a robot, or overwhelm its sensors, is the target
        robot’s Buffer rating +5. See Reprogramming a Robot on page 18 for more
        information.

-   name: Size
    category: Crux
    short: Siz
    desc: |
        (Siz) rates the robot’s physical dimensions. A Size 1 robot has about
        the same volume as a cube with 15 cm faces. A Size 2 robot approximates
        a cube with 30 cm faces, a Size 3 robot 45 cm, a Size 4 robot 60 cm,
        and a Size 5 robot 75 cm.

        A robot with a Size rating of 5 increases its Strength rating by 1.
        This can increase the robot’s Strength rating above 5.

        A robot with a Size rating of 1 increases its Dexterity rating by 1.
        This can increase the robot’s Dexterity rating above 5.

        For reference, an adult human approximates the same volume as a Size 4
        robot. A Size 5 robot has slightly more volume than a large human.

-   name: Power
    category: Crux
    short: Pow
    desc: |
        (Pow) rates how long the robot can operate on its own without
        recharging. A robot with a low Power rating can only function for a day
        or two without recharging, while a robot with a high rating can
        function independently for a week or more.

        Every day, the robot must make a Power check. At least one success (TN
        8) means the robot has enough power for another 24 hours. Failure means
        the robot’s battery is drained, and it must seek recharging.

        If a robot’s battery is drained, it has one hour to recharge before its
        Intelligence and Chassis ratings all degrade by 1. If the robot does
        not recharge, its Intelligence and Chassis ratings will continue to
        degrade at the rate of 1 per hour. These ratings revert to normal after
        a full recharge.

        Recharging normally takes one hour, unless otherwise stated.
