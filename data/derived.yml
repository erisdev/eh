-   name: Interaction Pool
    category: Physical Interaction
    derive: Dex + Ref
    desc: |
        (Dexterity rating + Reflexes rating)

        This is the dice pool a robot has to strike, grab, or otherwise
        manually interact with an unwilling robot or other mobile object. The
        robot makes contact if it has at least one success. A robot may only
        make one interaction check per round, regardless of how many limbs it
        has.

        If the robot is attacking another robot, it either in icts its normal
        strike damage (Strength rating ÷ 2, round down) or damage from a
        special feature (such as a saw). Only one feature may be used at a time
        when attacking. A robot can usually touch or strike an immobile object
        or robot without rolling an interaction check.

-   name: Damage from Strike
    category: Physical Interaction
    derive: Str / 2
    desc: |
        This is how much damage a robot can inflict by simply smashing its body
        or limbs into another object.

-   name: TN to be struck
    category: Physical Interaction
    derive: min(Mobil + Ref, 10)
    desc: |
        (Mobility rating + Reflexes rating)

        The TN to strike an alert robot is the target’s Mobility rating +
        Reflexes rating. A robot's TN to be struck may not be higher than 10.

-   name: Initiative
    category: Movement
    derive: Ref
    display: "1d10 + {value}"
    desc: |
        (1d10 + Reflexes rating)

        This measures which robots will act first in a conflict or other event
        where multiple robots attempt to act before each other.

        A robot’s initiative is determined by rolling a d10 and adding the
        robot’s Reflexes rating.

        For example, a player controlling a robot with a Reflexes rating of 3
        rolls a d10 and gets a 5. The robot's initiative roll for that conflict
        is 8 (3+5).

        Robots with higher initiative rolls act before robots with lower
        initiative rolls.

        Initiative totals are normally static throughout the conflict, but the
        Programmer may elect to reroll initiative at the beginning of every
        round, or whenever the situation changes. A particularly ready or alert
        robot may receive a +2 bonus to its first initiative total.

-   name: Speed
    category: Movement
    derive: Mobil + Ref
    desc: |
        (Mobility rating + Reflexes rating)

        This determines how fast a robot can move from one place to another. A
        robot’s Speed rating is equal to its speed in kilometers per hour
        during long journeys, or meters per round during conflict situations.

-   name: Damage Threshold
    category: Thresholds
    derive: Dur + Siz
    desc: |
        This is a measure of how hardy and resilient the robot’s physical body
        is. Robots with low Damage Threshold ratings are easily broken and hard
        to repair, while robots with high ratings can withstand tremendous
        damage and are easily fixed.

        A robot’s maximum Damage Threshold rating normally never changes. If a
        robot is damaged, its current Damage Threshold rating is lowered by the
        amount of damage inflicted. When a robot’s current Damage Threshold
        degrades to 0 or lower, the robot stops functioning and becomes
        unplayable until its current Damage Threshold is 1 or higher.

-   name: OS Threshold
    category: Thresholds
    derive: DigiCon + Buf
    desc: |
        (DigiCon rating + Buffer rating)

        This is a measure of how resilient and self-sustaining the robot’s
        “brain” is. Robots with low OS Threshold ratings are easily
        reprogrammed, while robots with high ratings are very resistant to modi
        cation.

        A robot’s maximum OS Threshold rating changes if its DigiCon rating
        degrades. If a robot’s programming is attacked, its current OS
        Threshold rating degrades.

        Likewise, if the robot is subject to a damaging electrical shock, its
        current OS threshold is lowered, just like its Damage Threshold would
        be lowered if the robot was the subject of a violent attack. If the
        robot's OS Threshold is lowered to 0 because of electrical shock or
        similar damage, the robot becomes unplayable until its OS Threshold is
        at least 1.
