-   name: Abrader
    category: Features
    cost: -10
    desc: |
        The robot has an erosive tool, such as a sandblaster or grinding wheel.
        
        The abrader inflicts damage equal to the abrader-equipped robot’s Size
        rating -2. The target robot may not use its Durability rating to reduce
        damage caused by the abrader.
        
-   name: Agile
    category: Features
    cost: -4
    desc: |
        The robot is more agile than a similar model.
        
        The robot’s TN to be struck is increased by 1. A robot’s TN to be
        struck may not be higher than 10.
    
-   name: Anchor
    category: Features
    cost: -5
    max: 5
    desc: |
        The robot has some mechanism to anchor itself in place.
    
        The robot adds one extra d10 per level of Anchor rating to all Strength
        checks to resist being moved.
    
        A robot may not have an Anchor rating higher than 5.

-   name: Android
    category: Features
    cost: -10
    max: HumanCom - 1
    desc: |
        The robot was designed to be indistinguishable from a human.

        A HumanCom check (TN 8) is required to determine that a robot with this
        feature is not a real human. The number of successes required is equal
        to the target robot's Android rating.

        A robot with this feature must have a Size rating of 3 or 4. A robot's
        Android rating may not be higher than its HumanCom rating -1.

-   name: Armored Chassis
    category: Features
    cost: -10
    max: Str - 1
    desc: |
        The robot’s frame is more durable than normal.
        
        Any impact or crushing damage (such as a club, Abrader, or Vice Grip)
        inflicted on the robot is automatically reduced by one point for every
        level of Armored Chassis rating.
        
        A robot's Armored Chassis rating may not be higher than its Strength
        rating -1.

-   name: Attendant Swarm
    category: Features
    cost: -6
    max: "MasterUnit ? MechaniCon * 2 : MechaniCon"
    desc: |
        The robot is always attended by a cluster of obedient drones.
    
        The robot has one drone for every level of Attendant Swarm rating. A
        robot may not have more drones than its MechaniCon rating unless it
        also has the Master Unit feature. Drones may be communicated with like
        other robots.

        A drone begins with the components that all robots receive for free,
        along with 19 points for attributes and features (instead of the 100
        points for attributes and features that robots normally begin with).
        Note that a drone’s attributes must all be at least rating 1 (meaning
        that at least 13 points must be spent on attributes before any features
        are purchased).

        Drones may have a maximum of 10 points worth of defects. A drone cannot
        have an Attendant Swarm of its own.

        Drones are treated as separate autonomous robots controlled by the
        player. Each drone's initiative is determined separately during
        conflict situations.

-   name: Backup System
    category: Features
    cost: -8
    desc: |
        The robot’s OS contains a separate backup system.

        If the robot’s current OS Threshold degrades to 0 from reprogramming
        attempts, the robot may make a DigiCon check (TN 8) after 1d10 minutes.
        If it has any successes, it may continue to make additional checks
        every 1d10 minutes until it has as many total successes as its maximum
        OS Threshold (at which point the reprogramming is nullified).

        If the robot fails more than one check in a row, its backup system
        fails to come online and will not automatically engage until its
        programming is reset.

-   name: Battering Ram
    category: Features
    cost: -12
    desc: |
        The robot has an onboard pneumatic ram, made for knocking in doors or
        driving in bolts.
        
        To use it, the robot makes a Strength check (TN 8) to anchor itself
        during its turn in an interaction sequence. A robot with the Anchor
        feature adds extra d10s to the Strength check equal to its Anchor
        rating. The ram is deployed immediately following the Strength check.
        The ram in icts damage equal to the anchor’s successes + the robot’s
        normal damage from strike.
        
        The battering ram can only be used against immobile or unsuspecting
        targets.
        
-   name: Biofrequency
    category: Features
    cost: -3
    max: 99
    desc: |
        The robot has special sensors that can detect the presence of organic
        lifeforms.

        The robot can detect plants or animals up to 10 meters away per level
        of Biofrequency Scanner rating, even through smoke or other
        obscurement. The scanner only detects the presence of biological
        matter, and cannot determine its specific type or current state.

-   name: Buoyant
    category: Features
    cost: -5
    desc: |
        The robot has an inflatable flotation device or some other mechanism
        that provides buoyancy.
        
        The robot cannot be submerged in water or other liquids while the
        feature is in use. A robot with the Buoyant feature cannot move under
        its own power unless it also has the Submersible feature.
    
-   name: Cargo Hauler
    category: Features
    cost: -3
    max: 99
    requires: 
        - External Container
        - Internal Compartment
        - Liquid Dispenser
    desc: |
        The robot can store more matter than a similar model.
        
        Each time this feature is purchased, the dimensions of one of the
        robot's storage containers are doubled. For example, a Size 2 external
        container approximates a cube 20 cm wide. The same container with the
        Cargo Hauler feature would approximate a cube 40 cm wide. A container's
        dimensions can only be increased once.
        
        A robot with the Cargo Hauler feature must already have the External
        Container, Internal Compartment or Liquid Dispenser feature.

-   name: Claw
    category: Features
    cost: -10
    desc: |
        The robot has a grasping claw that can attach to objects or other
        robots.
        
        If the robot makes a successful interaction check with the claw, the
        target robot must remain within reach of the robot using the claw. This
        condition will persist until the robot using the claw releases its
        grip, or until the Damage Threshold of the robot using the claw falls
        to 0.
        
        Either robot may attempt dragging checks as normal.

-   name: Collapsible
    category: Features
    cost: -4
    max: Siz - 2
    desc: |
        The robot can compact itself to occupy a smaller volume than normal.
        
        The robot can decrease its Size rating by 1 for every level of
        Collapsible rating. A robot may not have a Collapsible rating higher
        than its Size rating -2.
        
        When the robot is collapsed, its Dexterity and Mobility ratings degrade
        by 1 for every decrease in Size level. These ratings return to their
        previous states as the robot expands. This feature does not alter the
        robot's maximum Damage Threshold or TN to be dragged.

-   name: Common Model
    category: Features
    cost: -8
    conflicts:
        - Rare Model
    desc: |
        The robot was built using standard, easily-replaceable parts.
        
        All Perception checks to find replacement equipment for a robot with
        this feature gain one extra d10.
        
        A robot with this feature cannot have the Rare Model defect.

-   name: Cutting Laser
    category: Features
    cost: -15
    desc: |
        The robot has an onboard cutting laser that can penetrate most metals.

        The laser inflicts damage equal to the equipped robot’s Power rating
        +1. For example, a robot with a Power rating of 3 would in ict 4 points
        of damage.

        The laser has a range of approximately 10 cm per Size rating. For
        example, a Size 3 robot’s cutting laser has a maximum range of 30 cm.

        Striking an unwilling target with the cutting laser requires a
        successful interaction check.

-   name: Databank
    category: Features
    cost: -5
    max: DigiCon
    desc: |
        The robot has an extensive collection of information on a variety of
        topics.
        
        A robot with the Databank feature may make a DigiCon check (TN 8) to
        recall information on a topic. The robot adds its Databank rating to
        the check. The number of successes required for a particular topic or
        detail is determined by the Programmer.
        
        A robot may not have a Databank rating higher than its DigiCon rating.

-   name: Display Screen
    category: Features
    cost: -1
    max: 99
    desc: |
        The robot has an onboard video screen that can display status messages
        or play video recordings.
        
        A rating 1 screen is a simple monochromatic display, while higher-rated
        screens are more elaborate.

-   name: Disposal
    category: Features
    cost: -8
    desc: |
        The robot is equipped with an internal shredder, incinerator, or other
        device capable of quickly breaking up or destroying matter.

        Immobile robots are automatically damaged. Resisting robots must rst be
        caught (this requires an interaction check). The disposal in icts
        damage equal to the equipped robot’s Size rating -1.

        After being damaged, both robots make a contested Strength check (TN
        8). If the acting robot has more successes, the target robot is trapped
        in the disposal, and the acting robot may choose to automatically
        damage the target robot again during the acting robot's next
        initiative. The target robot may try to escape again during its next
        initiative.

        Only robots at least one Size rating below the disposal-equipped robot
        will fit in the disposal.

-   name: Buggy Cameras
    category: Defects
    cost: +5
    conflicts:
        - Enhanced Cameras
    desc: |
        The robot’s camera system is flawed.

        Every 1 rolled when using the robot's Perception rating negates one
        success made during that check. For example, a robot with RealityCom 3
        and Perception 4 makes a check to predict the weather. It rolls 5, 1,
        and 8 for its RealityCom and 9, 1, 3, and 5 for its Perception. Because
        the robot rolled two 1s, two successes are cancelled out.
        
        This defect cannot reduce the number of successes rolled to fewer than
        0. A robot with the Buggy Cameras defect cannot have the Enhanced
        Cameras feature.
